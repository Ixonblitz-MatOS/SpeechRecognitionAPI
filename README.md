    <h3>USE:</h3><br>
    <p>To use this module start off by creating a new Microphone like so:</p><br>
    <p>#{VariableName} represents your name of the variable</p><br>
    <p>{VariableName} = Microphone()</p><br>
    <p>Spoken_Words = {VariableName}.listen()</p><br>
    <p>#Spoken_Words is the variable that takes the text spoken into the microphone and converts it to string.</p><br>
    <p>#You can manipulate the text as you want such as just printing or putting into text file perhaps</p>
