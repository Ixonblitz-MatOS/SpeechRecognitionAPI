# SpeechRecognitionAPI
Python Speech Recognition import class, Requirements text file, and install batch file
This is a fairly simple import.

INSTALL:
Make sure you have pip installed on your computer and then run INSTALL.bat and it will install the required modules for the class.

USE:
To use this module start off by creating a new Microphone like so:
    #{VariableName} represents your name of the variable
    {VariableName} = Microphone()
    Spoken_Words = {VariableName}.listen()
    #Spoken_Words is the variable that takes the text spoken into the microphone and converts it to string. You can manipulate the text as you want such as just printing or putting into text file perhaps
